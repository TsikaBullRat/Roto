                    The ROTO Centre was established as a non-
                    profit organization in 2016 when Mpho
                    Matthews, the founder, joined up with other
                    individuals wanting to create a safe place
                    with educational activities and support
                    services that would cater to the specific
                    needs of special needs children. The need
                    for such an organization was realized
                    through the founderâ€™s own personal
                    experience of having a child that has
                    special needs. To date, ROTO is the only
                    special needs day care centre in Barkley
                    West, serving more than 20 families each
                    day between Monday to Saturday with a
                    variety of programs and services.
